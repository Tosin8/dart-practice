1. // A single line comment. 
2. VOID - a special type that indicates a value that's never used.
3. INT - indicates an integer. 
4. $variableName (or ${expression}) - string interpolation, including a variable or expression's string equivalent inside of a string literal. 
5. MAIN() - The special required top level function where app executes starts. 
6. VAR - a way to declare a variable without specifying its type. 

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS: 
* Object: everything being placed inside a variable
* Class: it's an instance of every Object
* A variable can be make nullable by putting a question mark (?) at the end of its type. 
* Dart supports generic types, like List<int> ( a list of integers) or List<Object> (a list of Objects of any type)
* Dart supports top level functions, such as main() as well as functions tied to a class or Object( static and instance methods respectively). A functions can be created within functions ( nested or local functions). 
* Private keywords start with underscore (_), making it private to its library. 
*If-else statement in dart - conditional expression condition ? expr1 : expr2
* Dart tools can report two kinds of problems: WARNINGS ( they are just indications that code might not work but they don't prevent the program from executing) and ERRORS ( it can either compile-time or run-time). 

VARIABLES - it stores references.
